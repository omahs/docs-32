  Welcome to Tableland, where the only limit is your imagination (and some
  hard-coded constraints).

# Limits

Tableland isn't a new database — it’s just Web3-native relational tables. This means there are no limits to the new types of interactions and experiences you can build on Tableland. But with great power comes great responsibility! For now, each table is limited to the following constraints:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Constraint</th>
            <th data-type="number">Max Size</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Rows</td>
            <td>100000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Columns</td>
            <td>24</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Text Length</td>
            <td>1024</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Read Query Length</td>
            <td>35 KB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Write Query Length</td>
            <td>35 KB</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
