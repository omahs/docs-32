## Explore with our API

If raw REST and RPC APIs are more your thing, then you might be more comfortable digging into our raw APIs. You can find API specs, command line examples, and more in our Remote API guide.

## Tinker from the CLI

Sometimes you just wanna type stuff into a terminal and observe the results. That's what the experimental command line tools for Tableland are for. Read on to get started playing with Tableland from the comfort of your command line.
